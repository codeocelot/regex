# regex
My solution to the canonical "implement regex" interview question.

Sharing this on github because I found it to be an enlightening problem to solve.

Before you look at the solution in regex.py, give yourself half an hour to work through the problem conceptually!  How would *you* implement a regex pattern matcher?
